        also in some of the class methods. DO NOT DELETE OR UNDEFINE IT. YOU
        MAY CHANGE IT TO SUIT YOUR NEEDS.

        YOU SHOULD DELETE EVERYTHING FROM HERE DOWN IF I DIDN'T REMOVE IT BEFORE PUBLISHING.

        It won't hurt anything if you leave it in. It's only here so that I can leave the
        rest of the source code generic enough to release without much custom configuration.
        What it's doing is checking my production flag to pick the directory that Wordpress
        lives in on dev vs production, and is used ONLY for setting |$dump_wordpressdir|
        in the JDBlogPostsController. This is a public var that you will set, too.

        Say, if you want to, you can leave this here and use it, but it's not very Cake-like.
