<h1>JDWordpress Plugin for CakePHP </h1>
<p>©2014 by Jim Derry and balthisar.com</p>
<h2>Purpose </h2>
<p>This plugin lets you integrate your Wordpress database into your CakePHP site with minimum effort. It uses none of Wordpress’ functionality to perform any of its work; it’s completely independent and requires only Wordpress’s database.</p>
<p>Oh, unlike Wordpress, you can write your articles in MarkdownExtra format. And, if you like, any source code can be syntax highlighted with the built-in GeSHi.</p>
<p>Note that there’s currently <em>not</em> any support for Wordpress’ comments system or user management at all. This is a design feature and not a bug or oversight, since presumably you have an existing CakePHP application and want to use your own security and user management systems.</p>
<p>Also there’s no support for generating Wordpress content. You should use Wordpress and its excellent tools for that, otherwise why have Wordpress at all? We’re only interested in showing Wordpress’ data.</p>
<h2>Some Cool Features </h2>
<p>The most prominent feature is that you don’t have to run Wordpress as your front-end; you can run your CakePHP site and pull in content wherever you want it. Because JDWordpress only requires the database from Wordpress, you can run Wordpress backend in another directory, subdomain, or even other machine.</p>
<p>Live support for index pages showing all tags, all categories, all articles. Programmatic support for all taxonomies and a rich set of structures and elements for displaying them on your own site.</p>
<p>"Magic" view method that accepts article slugs, a quantity of articles, category slugs, author slugs, tag slugs &ndash; whatever &ndash; and delivers the right page with the right results. No more forcing your users to type URIs with <code>/tag/cool</code>, <code>category/swimming</code>, <code>author/balthisar</code>, or <code>article/2014/02/01/my-cool-swimming-article-by-balthisar</code>.</p>
<p>Aside from whole blog pages, JDWordpress offers three ways to pull a lot of different data into your own application for display.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Several controller actions are meant especially for <code>requestAction</code> calls, as these are easy for designers to implement. You shouldn't use them, but it’s quick and easy to do during development.</li>
<li>The Helper provides several methods that can pull data and provide a rendered element on demand for any of your application’s pages that you wish. You probably shouldn't use the helper for this, but they’re quick and easy to use during development.</li>
<li>The component can be used in your own AppController to make any data available to any or all of your views, and you can render this data easily with built-in or your own view elements. This is the CakePHP way of doing things.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Quick Installation </h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Drop the whole plugin directory into your <code>app/Plugin</code> folder.</li>
<li>Modify your own <code>Config/database.php</code> file to add a new config called <code>$JDWordpressDB</code> properly setup for your Wordpress database.</li>
<li>Modify your own <code>Config/bootstrap.php</code> file to load the the plugin: `CakePlugin::load(array('JDWordpress' =&gt; array('routes' =&gt; true)));`</li>
<li>Edit the file <code><a class="el" href="routes_8php.html" title="Part of plugin JDWordpress ">app/Plugin/JDWordpress/Config/routes.php</a></code> so that the constant <code>JDWP_PATH</code> matches the URI path to your blog. <em>This is important</em> because the plugin needs to know where permalinks and such should point to.</li>
<li>The default views are in <code>JDWordpress/View/JDBlogPosts</code> per convention. They’re pretty spartan, but don’t be in a hurry to replace them. You should instead override them with your own versions in <code>app/View/Plugin/JDWordpress/JDBlogPosts/</code>, per CakePHP convention.</li>
<li>If you want to use the helper in your views, then add <code>JDWordpress.JDBlogPost</code> to your <code>$helpers</code> array in <code>Controllers/AppController.php</code> or in the individual controllers whose views you want the helper available.</li>
<li><p class="startli">If you want to use the component then add the component to your <code>$components</code> array in <code>Controllers/AppController.php</code> or in the individual controllers whose views you want to populate with data. Use this format for adding the component:</p>
<p class="startli">`'JDWordpress.JDBlogPostData' =&gt; [ 'jd_vars' =&gt; [] ] );`</p>
<p class="startli">You can look at values to put into the <code>jd_vars</code> array in the file <code><a class="el" href="JDBlogPostDataComponent_8php.html" title="Part of plugin JDWordpress ">JDWordpress/Controller/Component/JDBlogPostDataComponent.php</a></code>, although you don’t have to put anything there for now.</p>
</li>
<li>Later (advanced) you’ll probably want to make changes to the file in <code><a class="el" href="JDBlogPostDataComponent_8php.html" title="Part of plugin JDWordpress ">JDWordpress/Controller/Component/JDBlogPostDataComponent.php</a></code>. It’s not really configuration per se, but if you get tired of setting CSS classes for the plugin in your code per step 7, you can set the defaults in this file. Really, don’t worry about it for now.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Quick Start </h2>
<p>Note than in step 4, the default is “blog” and that’s how I will refer to the URI path for the rest of these instructions. Also let’s assume that you already have at least a few published posts available in your Wordpress database.</p>
<p>Try visiting these new sections of your site:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog">http://www.example.com/blog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/tags">http://www.example.com/blog/tags</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/archives">http://www.example.com/blog/archives</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/categories">http://www.example.com/blog/categories</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/some-article-tag">http://www.example.com/blog/some-article-tag</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/some-category-slug">http://www.example.com/blog/some-category-slug</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/rss">http://www.example.com/blog/rss</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.example.com/blog/rss/some-category-slug">http://www.example.com/blog/rss/some-category-slug</a></li>
</ol>
<p>And so on.</p>
<h2>Some Quick Examples </h2>
<p>All of the many pages above are nice if all you want to do is allow your visitors to view whole pages. In general, though, you will want to show last five posts, list all categories, etc., someplace else on your site. These three examples show how you might do it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">`echo $this-&gt;JDBlogPost-&gt;tocRecent('developer');`</p>
<p class="startli">This example uses the helper to return a fully rendered element with the data you requested. In this case it would return a rendered <code>tocRecent</code> element with a table of contents for some slug called 'developer'. It could be tag, category, or author.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>echo $this-&gt;requestAction("/blog/tocRecent/developer");</code></p>
<p class="startli">Same as above, but it uses <code>requestAction</code> to get the view from the controller. Note that <code>requestAction</code> currently cannot access plugin controllers in the array format, and so this will cause a complete CakePHP request cycle. It’s not a recommended best practice to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">`echo $this-&gt;element('requestAction/tocRecent', $dataForTocRecentSlug, ['plugin' =&gt; 'JDWordpress'] );`</p>
<p class="startli">The same as above, but simply, harmlessly draws one of the built-in elements using data supplied by your controller. You could use your element (and not need the plugin array). Note that for organization all of the built-in elements are located in Elements/requestAction/ of the plugin.</p>
<p class="startli">This last example is a best-practice and the most Cake-like way of doing things. However it requires an extra step not shown in the example; you actually have to set the <code>$dataForTocRecentSlug</code> view variable in your controller (typically this might be your AppController). In this example the <code>AppController::beforeFilter</code> would have to have a line such as `$this-&gt;set( 'dataForTocRecentSlug', $this-&gt;JDBlogPostData-&gt;tocRecent('developer'));` which illustrates how to use the component (<em>Quick Installation</em>, step 7).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use at the Source, Luke! </h2>
<p>The source code is fairly well (if unconventionally) documented. Even if you just want to use the Plugin without knowing how it works, take a look at the comments for the methods in the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code><a class="el" href="classJDBlogPostsController.html" title="This class implements all actions for JDWordpress. ">JDBlogPostsController</a></code> which has all of the actions (including <code>requestAction</code> actions) you might employ.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classJDBlogPostDataComponent.html">JDBlogPostDataComponent</a></code> to see which CSS classes are assigned when using the default views and templates and helpers. It also has all of the component methods for populating your view data. <b>Look at them</b>.</li>
<li><code><a class="el" href="classJDBlogPostHelper.html" title="This class implements the display helper for the JDWordpress plugin. ">JDBlogPostHelper</a></code> to see which helper methods are available to you.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use MarkdownExtra </h2>
<p>Rather than requiring you add extra data fields to your Wordpress database, we’ve simply adopted a shebang. Make sure you edit your Wordpress posts in text format, and also make sure that the first line consists of <code>#!md</code> &ndash; that’s it. JDWordpress will take care of the rest.</p>
<h2>How to use GeSHi </h2>
<p>JDWordpress introduces <em>rudimentary</em> GeSHi support for syntax highlighting blocks of code in your posts. Simply format your code such:</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~ {.geshi .html} </p>
<pre>
<code class="geshi geshilinenumbers language">
...
</code>
</pre><p> ~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Where “language” is the GeSHi supported language that you’s like to highlight, and “geshilinenumbers” is optional; include it only if you want line numbers.</p>
<p>If you want fancier styling, take a look at the generated HTML for the classes that GeSHi generates, and you can improve appearance in CSS.</p>
